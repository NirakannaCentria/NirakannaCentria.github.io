                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Anna, and I am from Finland. I have lived here my whole life. I am 39 years old, married, and have two daughters.
                    Right now, I am working as a System developer for a local company, and I am more and more starting to transition into working with IT and mainly ERP systems which is my main interest.</p>
                    <p>Before this I have mostly been working with customer service as I have a bachelor’s degree in business administration, but a few years ago I got the opportunity to work with ERP systems and since then I have leaned more into the field of IT.
                    <p>I decided I wanted to deepen my knowledge and test my limits, so I applied to Centrias IT program 2 years ago and I hope to graduate within 2-3 years.</p>
                <p>About six years ago I had just joined a workplace, where the tempo and demands where high, but I liked it. The problem was there was no aspect of my life where the tempo was slower.
                    We had two small children, one of them didn’t sleep, which meant I didn’t sleep, and we were also moving into our dream home.</p>
                <p> From the outside, everything looked perfect. The perfect family in their perfect home, with their perfect jobs and perfect hobbies.

                <h2>The Way to Burnout</h2>
                <p><pLack of sleep and insomnia started to catch up with me during the autumn of 2018. I was lucky to get 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. We got no help from the pediatricians and where just told to be stricter with our daughter, which of course didn’t help one bit. At work I was given tasks that I either had to fix fast or tasks that didn’t belong to me. At this stage in my life, I was a person who didn’t use the word “no”. </p>
                <p>No was simply not an option, instead I spent evenings (and nights) and weekends worrying about my job and what I had to do, and at this point I also tried my hardest to secure a fulltime placement at this company as I was only a temporary employee. </p>
                <p>During the winter of 2018-2019 I was constantly sick and depressed. But no matter how tired I was, I kept pushing it at work and I was still doing Crossfit 2-4 times a week. Eventually I started having periods of intense panic attacks at work and during nights and I also had periods when I couldn’t eat. So, I just would sit and stare at my lunch or just throw it away and have a coffee instead. </p>
                <p>Writing this out now, gives me chills. How did I not stop? Why did I keep treating myself this way? And how and why didn’t anyone see me struggling? </p>
                <p>When I was finally able to go on my summer vacation summer of 2019, I crashed. At first, I didn’t do anything but sleep, but then suddenly I couldn’t sleep at all. Eventually, the people around started to see I was suffering and after a mental break down I was taken to the hospital where I stayed for two weeks, and after this, I had to be on sick leave for a few months.
