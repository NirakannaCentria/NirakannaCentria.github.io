                <p class="more-info">My name is Anna, and I am from Finland. I have lived here my whole life. I am 39
                    years old, married,
                    and have two daughters.
                    Right now, I am working as a System developer for a local company, and I am more and more starting
                    to transition into working with IT and mainly ERP systems which is my main interest.
                Before this I have mostly been working with customer service as I have a bachelor’s degree in
                    business administration, but a few years ago I got the opportunity to work with ERP systems and
                    since then I have leaned more into the field of IT.
                I decided I wanted to deepen my knowledge and test my limits, so I applied to Centrias IT program 2
                    years ago and I hope to graduate within 2-3 years.
                About six years ago I had just joined a workplace, where the tempo and demands where high, but I
                    liked it. The problem was there was no aspect of my life where the tempo was slower.
                    We had two small children, one of them didn’t sleep, which meant I didn’t sleep, and we were also
                    moving into our dream home.
                From the outside, everything looked perfect. The perfect family in their perfect home, with their
                    perfect jobs and perfect hobbies.

                <h2>The Way to Burnout</h2>
                <p>Lack of sleep and insomnia started to catch up with me during the autumn of 2018. I was lucky to get
                    4 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. We got no help from the pediatricians and where just told
                    to be stricter with our daughter, which of course didn’t help one bit. At work I was given tasks
                    that I either had to fix fast or tasks that didn’t belong to me. At this stage in my life, I was a
                    person who didn’t use the word “no”. </p>
                <p>No was simply not an option, instead I spent evenings (and nights) and weekends worrying about my job
                    and what I had to do, and at this point I also tried my hardest to secure a fulltime placement at
                    this company as I was only a temporary employee. </p>
                <p>During the winter of 2018-2019 I was constantly sick and depressed. But no matter how tired I was, I
                    kept pushing it at work and I was still doing Crossfit 2-4 times a week. Eventually I started having
                    periods of intense panic attacks at work and during nights and I also had periods when I couldn’t
                    eat. So, I just would sit and stare at my lunch or just throw it away and have a coffee instead.
                </p>
                <p>Writing this out now, gives me chills. How did I not stop? Why did I keep treating myself this way?
                    And how and why didn’t anyone see me struggling? </p>
                <p>When I was finally able to go on my summer vacation summer of 2019, I crashed. At first, I didn’t do
                    anything but sleep, but then suddenly I couldn’t sleep at all. Eventually, the people around started
                    to see I was suffering and after a mental break down I was taken to the hospital where I stayed for
                    two weeks, and after this, I had to be on sick leave for a few months.

                <h2>Toxic Work Cultures and Toxic Gender Roles</h2>
                <p>The road to recovery from a burnout is long and lonely. I also discovered that it comes with lots of
                    ups and downs. </p>
                <p>During my sick leave, at first, I didn’t feel anything but emptiness. Then came the anger. The anger
                    over that I was overloaded and undervalued, and anger and resentment towards supervisors who turned
                    a blind eye to my apparent struggles. The anger at the culture of this area in Finland where you are
                    supposed to never complain and keep your head up and just give a 100% all the time. And the anger
                    over the injustice that we as women are supposed to do all and be all for our children and men are
                    awarded with praise for doing the bare minimum. </p>
                <p>The way women are made the default parent in all situations still angers me. Both me and my husband
                    battles with this constantly. The school still calls me first or sends messages to just me. This
                    just adds to the burden of being the main project leader of the household that women are expected to
                    carry. </p>
                <p>When it was time to go back to work, there was nothing left of the soft person I used to be. I was
                    bitter and angry, and I guarded my mental health and peace of mind fiercely. I had help from a great
                    therapist who advised me to not accept meetings that where set up the same day, to not take work
                    calls out of work hours and to avoid colleagues that caused stress. </p>
                <p>I started to notice things about my workplace that I didn’t like. One thing was that there was always
                    a sense of urgency. There was a lot of reactive leadership and no pro-active management. I found
                    myself reacting badly to this urgency and started to question this urgency whenever I was given a
                    task that required, I deal with it urgently, and did the tasks I was given in a tempo that suited me
                    better. Another thing was that I was not taken seriously. I hadn’t noticed this before but suddenly
                    it annoyed me that certain people tried to bully me into submission and to give them what they
                    wanted</p>
                <p>During my first year back I found myself on sick leave a lot. Periods of insomnia caused panic
                    attacks and migraines, hormonal issues served me some crippling symptoms that I didn’t expect, and
                    every flu and stomach bug that circulated in daycare found its way to me. I hated this sensitivity
                    but took the symptoms seriously and slowed down my tempo when I needed.

                <h2>Recovery</h2>
                <p>More and more I realized this workplace was not for me but I right then, it would have been too big
                    of a step to change job. I realized I needed a plan to transition to something else and during the
                    pandemic I just felt it was too risky to go for a new job, so I started to look around for an
                    education in something IT related. </p>
                <p>I was lucky to be accepted to Centria and was able to go down to parttime with my current job, which
                    was a relief. </p>
                <p>During this time I have been in therapy and I am forever going to be grateful of the things I have
                    learned and the support I have been given. </p>
                <p>I have learned to respect myself, stand up for my needs and most importantly, stand up against others
                    who want to take advantage of me or just ignore people who are not comfortable with me living the
                    life I want.</p>
                <p>Recovery from a burnout is not like recovering from an illness or injury. I have come to realize it
                    is about re-inventing yourself and becoming who you are supposed to be. The people who have
                    benefitted from you not standing up for yourself are going to protest you for you finally doing so.
                    It is important to find allies that will support you in this process.
