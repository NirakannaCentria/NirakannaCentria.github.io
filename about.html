        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As already mentioned, I burned out 5 years ago. I quickly learned that you don't recover from a burn out. You re-invent yourself, as you can no longer be the person who drove head first into the famous wall, by trying to please anyone and everyone.</p>
        <p>I tried to do everything. Be a mother, be a hard worker and an appreciated colleague, be a good wife, be someones best friend and a daughter to be proud of. All that at the same time as one of my children did not sleep, so naturally, I didn't sleep. </p>
