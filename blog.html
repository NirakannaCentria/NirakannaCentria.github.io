                <h2>Guilt</h2>
                <p class="post-date">May 27, 2024</p>
                <p>One major reason behind burnout is guilt. Guilt over not being enough or doing enough. I felt guilty
                    for not engaging enough with my kids after work and for not reaching out to family and friends
                    during evenings and weekends because I was so exhausted. I felt guilty for taking time to myself and
                    doing Crossfit instead of cleaning or doing household chores. It felt horrible being at home because
                    no matter where I looked there was something that caught my eyes that caused me to feel guilty</p>
                <p>Then there was the guilt at work. I felt guilty for not being competent enough to deal with the tasks
                    I was given and guilt for taking long to finish them. I felt guilty for not prioritizing the correct
                    tasks at the correct time and all in all I just felt like I wasn’t good enough. </p>
                <p>There is no easy way to get rid of this guilt. That you are feeling guilt in the first place is an
                    indicator that you care, and that you are loyal towards your family, friends and workplace. But too
                    much is too much.</p>
                <p>The key to minimizing it however, is treating yourself with the love and patience that you would give
                    to your best friend dealing with the same feelings.</p>
                <p>It is also of great importance to realize that if you are working full time there will not be enough
                    time to be the best mother, the best wife or husband or the bestest friend anyone has ever had.</p>
                <p>Social media is wonderful in a way that it will help us find people around the globe that we share
                    interests and personalities with, but it has also ruined the self-esteem of many people. We are
                    presented with seemingly perfect people living perfect lifes being perfect parents, spouses and
                    friends. And watching all this will make us feel inadequate in many ways. </p>
                <p>So one of my first tips is to take a long critical list of all the accounts you follow of social
                    media and ruthlessly clean your list, anyone or anything making you feel bad about yourself or your
                    living situation needs to go. Like, if you don’t like your body or you feel guilt over not looking a
                    certain way, hit that unfollow-button quickly on any influencer who or account that make you feel
                    bad. </p>
                <p>Second tip is to sit down and make a general list of things that need to be done to make your
                    household run smoothly on daily and weekly basis. Make rough estimate on how much time these things
                    take per day and then look at what you realistically can accomplish. </p>
                <p>This leads me to my third tip. If you live together with other people or like me, in a core family
                    constellation, delegate tasks. This may be the most important tip, because it is never just one
                    person’s job make the household run smoothly. It is everyone’s responsibility to make the home a
                    pleasant place to be in for everyone. In our household everyone has tasks and jobs to do every day.
                    This is not optional, parents, and especially mothers are not anyone’s maids or servants. If you
                    child can operate a smart phone they can operate dishwashers, laundry machines and vacuum cleaners.
                </p>
                <p>The phrasing “help your mom” gives me the ick. You’re not helping, you should be contributing to the
                    household if you live in a household. </p>

                <h2>Boundries at work</h2>
                <p class="post-date">May 28, 2024</p>
                <p>Setting healthy boundaries at work is complicated. On one hand you maybe want a promotion, and
                    therefore want to prove yourself. On the other hand, you don’t want to slave away for nothing if
                    that promotion never comes. </p>
                <p>Getting along with difficult colleagues can also be draining, or dealing with a toxic work culture
                    can cause exhaustion. </p>
                <p>Sexism and discrimination can also cause all sorts of issue. Many women and people of color have said
                    that they have to work twice as hard as the average white guy to get the same recognition and
                    appreciation. </p>
                <p>One major thing I have learned through the years after my burnout, is that HR is almost never your
                    friend. They serve the company first and the employees second. If you have been on sickleave for a
                    burnout you may already be on their “blacklist”. Maybe not for the sick leave in itself but for
                    being regarded a difficult employee for setting boundaries at your return. With HR, keep a healthy
                    distance and DO NOT give them more details about your private life than you must. </p>
                <p>My first rule for having a healthier relationship with any employer or work place is setting
                    boundaries on availability. You are only available for work calls when you are on the clock, do not
                    take work calls or meeting that are outside of your work hours. </p>
                <p>Second rule is to not give my colleagues any of my private contact information, or befriend them on
                    social media. This is very difficult where I live because we tend not to keep work relationships and
                    private relationships separated here, as it is a small place, and I have relaxed this rule and
                    follow some colleagues on social media nowadays, but if I felt that it would cause stress at any
                    point I wouldn’t hesitate to unfollow or unfriend, or even block.</p>
                <p>Third rule I have is to always put my name on everything that I make, no one is steeling my credit
                    anymore. </p>
                <p>Fourth rule, I always treat everyone with respect and kindness, and I never speak bad about
                    colleagues or gossip. They can speak whatever they want but I will not engage and will always try to
                    diffuse the situation if anyone tries. Because if the speak like that to you, they will speak like
                    that about you too, to someone else. </p>
                </p>

                <h2>Red Flags at work</h2>
                <p class="post-date">May 29, 2024</p>
                <p>
                <p>There are many workplaces that are still very toxic to be at and the list can go on forever, but here
                    are some personal red flags that I have experienced. </p>
                <p>1. People already working for the company are never promoted, only new hires are given important
                    roles. This signals that the management has no faith in their employees or does not want to pay
                    higher salaries to match new responsibilities</p>
                <p>2. You are not allowed to discuss your pay with your colleagues. This signals that management are
                    aware they are underpaying some or all individuals working there and try to get away with it. </p>
                <p>3. Sexual harassments are hushed up or misogynist talk or racist talk is ignored. This signals a weak
                    management or worse, they are like this themselves. </p>
                <p>4. Tasks are being piled up on you or other individuals without asking if you or they have the
                    capacity to take on tasks at the moment. </p>
                <p>5. Promotions are given based on favoritism or personal preference, rather than skill. This signals
                    immature management that rather play with their buddies at work than improve the work quality and
                    building and developing the company. </p>
                <p>6. People in managing positions openly speak bad about their team members or other workers. This
                    signals not just toxicity but down right hostility. </p>
                <p>7. There is a clear division between people in production and people in administration, and they
                    don’t get along. Even worse if some department is enjoying benefits that another department doesn’t.
                </p>
                <p>8. Unclear company goals. No one can give a clear idea of what they want, or everyone seems to have
                    an idea of their own. This signal that there is a lack of unity and trust in the company itself.
                </p>
                <p>9. Poor communication in the workplace. I have one really bad example of showing up on my first day
                    and no one knew I was supposed to start working there. The person who hired me was running late and
                    didn’t answer her phone and the security guard refused to let me in. I did not feel welcomed at all.
                    Thank God it was a temporary job. </p>
                <p>10. No forms of appreciation or very poorly executed forms of appreciation. If you never get to have
                    a Christmas party or get any gifts or treats for jobs well done, you are not appreciated. I worked
                    for the government once and they simply cut costs and no one received anything, lets just say that
                    the morale was very low there... My friend was working a lot of double shifts during Covid, and the
                    ones who did got a banana as a thank you. A single banana. No extra overtime compensation or a party
                    when Covid was deemed non-threatening, and society opened up again. Just a banana. She later quit.
                </p>
                <p>There are of course many more red flags, but these are some personal ones that I have witnessed and
                    experienced. I will also post my personal green flags. </p>

                <h2>Feminism</h2>
                <p class="post-date">May 30, 2024</p>
                <p>You can’t talk about burnout without talking about feminism.</p>
                <p>Feminism has given us so much and gender equality should be a top priority for everyone, man or
                    woman. I feel however that as women have worked hard to enter the workforce and contribute to
                    society, men as group have lagged behind.</p>
                <p>Women are still the ones who do end organize the majority of household labors. Mother are often the
                    default parent and the one to stay home with children, which can affect us negatively in terms of
                    promotions and opportunities. In many ways, women are expected to work as if they don’t have
                    children and be mothers as if they don’t have jobs. This is an unfair situation and an impossible
                    equation to solve. </p>
                <p>In my experience, as women we also have to work harder and contribute more to our employers to gain
                    the same recognition and opportunities as the men. </p>
                <p>There are expectations set upon us that the men are freed from. If someone drops by our house and it
                    is messy, it is not my husband that gets the comment on how messy it is, rather I will get the
                    comment “why do you allow this house to be so messy?” or “looks like mom has some cleaning to do!”
                </p>
                <p>If my husband was late for pick-up from daycare, the teachers were forgiving, whereas I got petty
                    comments on how important it is to be on time when my kids have missed me so much all day.</p>
                <p>My generation of women were told we could have it all; a marriage, a family and a career! But no one
                    told the men of my generation that they will marry women who will try to get it all, which means
                    that they will have do more than their fathers. The society also didn’t get the memo to stop
                    expecting miracles from women that they don’t expect from men.</p>
                <p>I think that is part of the problem, our fathers were not as involved as fathers are today, which
                    means if they compare themselves to their own fathers they are going to come out on top. If you as a
                    man do the bare minimum of changing diapers of your own kid and your father didn’t, you are at least
                    better than him.</p>
                <p>Creating an equal household is tricky. There is no “one-size-fits-all” approach, other than to
                    discussing the unfair situations and, as women, demand equal division of labor and divide certain
                    areas of responsibilities between you and your partner. </p>
                <p>A small thing for us is, I do laundry, but he vacuums. If he cooks, I will clean the kitchen. We also
                    try to follow a plan for cleaning, so something gets done every day. Monday, we focus on the
                    kitchen, Tuesdays we focus on bathrooms, Wednesdays everyone cleans their own room, etc. He also
                    does like 95% of all outdoor jobs like chopping wood and taking care of the garden, so I take care
                    of anything that the children need in form of clothes, shoes, medicine and hygiene products. </p>
                <p>I am still very much the default person when it comes to any school issues, but he always attends
                    meetings with teachers without me demanding it and this shows me that he is someone I can trust and
                    co-parent and our relationship is not something adding to my stress bucket.</p>
                <p>If you are stuck in a household where you are the project manager, coordinator and the key person
                    that gets everything done and if you as a woman feel that you are single parent in a two-parent
                    household, you need to either leave or seek couples’ therapy. If you feel like your relationship is
                    draining you, alarm bells should start ringing in your head. He is not going to fix himself or step
                    up unless he is required to do so and sometimes an outside person needs to point it out to him. </p>
                <p>Coming home from a long day should feel like just that; coming home. If you feel like you are just
                    clocking in for your next (unpaid) job when you step inside your home, you need to start working and
                    thinking about how you want things to change. </p>
                </p>

                <h2>Friendships and other relationships</h2>
                <p class="post-date">May 31, 2024</p>
                <p>One thing that I have felt quilt for is not having enough energy to be a good friend anymore since my
                    burnout.</p>
                <p>I also feel like I have limited energy for socializing and I have to watch carefully how much time I
                    am spending among people and I have to make sure to get enough time afterwards for recovery. </p>
                <p>Burning out made me put almost every relationship I had on hold. I no longer had the energy to make
                    an effort and I noticed how many relationships just died off or changed when I stopped making the
                    effort</p>
                <p>It hurt a lot to see that some friendships that I regarded important, were not so important to the
                    other part.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, other relationships grew stronger because the ones that accepted the radio silence
                    for a while, where my greatest supporters and these people are so much more important to me today.
                </p>
                <p>My best friend, who absolutely deserved a better friend than me at that point, as she herself
                    struggled quite a bit, never once gave me a hard time for not answering the phone or any of her
                    messages. Instead, she reached out to others to make sure I was okay and just let me know that she
                    is there, whenever I am ready again. </p>
                <p>People who support in hard times are special, but when you are burnt out you can’t appreciate it
                    properly, you are in survival mode and my therapist said beautifully that no flowers grow in the
                    survival zone. </p>
                <p>When you get out of the survival zone, guilt usually creeps in and makes you feel bad for ignoring
                    your friends and family. To silence this guilt, set up a plan for how and to whom you want to keep
                    up a relation with. Are the expectations from friends and family too much to handle?</p>
                <p>My plan consisted of what I am willing to do for friends, family and relatives. For friends, I make
                    sure I am reaching out once a week, through text message or a phone call. At this stage in life,
                    meeting up to frequently would cause a lot of stress for me. For family (parents, siblings) and in
                    laws I try to reach out about once a week too, and also visit as they live close by. But for other
                    relatives, I no longer reach out or feel guilty about not doing so, some showed no understanding or
                    respect when I was at my worst, and I am protecting myself from future disappointments. They are not
                    bad people, but they also don’t contribute to my peace of mind, so I keep contact to a minimum. </p>
                <p>Protecting your peace of mind becomes a top priority when you start your recovery. Pay close
                    attention to how people make you feel! If you feel drained from social interaction, try to think if
                    it was the setting itself or if it was the people? If the setting was noisy and crowded, naturally
                    that would make you tired, but if the company caused you to feel exhausted, you need to do your best
                    to avoid them in the future! </p>

                <h2>Green flags in the workplace</h2>
                <p class="post-date">June 1, 2024</p>
                <p class="text-preview">I have been fortunate to find a good employer now, and I have had some great
                    experiences also at
                    places that were not so great in other ways.

                <p class="more-info">
                    I have been fortunate to find a good employer now, and I have had some great
                    experiences also at
                    places that were not so great in other ways.
                    1. A green flag is making internal communication a top priority. Informing staff on new hires and
                    events and making sure information reaches everyone signals that they care about their employees.
                    2. Promotions are given fairly and transparently. Everyone is informed about an
                    opportunity to apply,
                    and all applications are handled privately. This signals that employees are valued and that the
                    employer values personal development.
                    3. Discrimination, sexism and racism is discussed and there is a code of conduct, and everyone is
                    informed and trained about the code of conduct. This signals again that everyone is valued and
                    appreciated.
                    4. Employee satisfaction is taken seriously and appreciation for hard work is the norm. There are
                    bonuses, staff parties, and small gifts to symbolize the appreciation. Also benefits in the form of
                    “wellness”, the employer sponsors gym memberships, massages or cultural or sports events.
                    5. Personal development is encouraged and appropriate pay raises are given to the one who is
                    promoted. Again appreciation is a must for a good working climate
                    There are again a lot more one could add to this list but these are some the things that I
                    personally
                    feel that have made me appreciate my work place now.
