                    experiences with burnout and how I had to change my life and my way of thinking to not only survive
                    but also thrive in life. I am still halfway surviving, but my goal is to thrive. In this corner I
                    will share my lessons learned, give tips on setting healthy boundaries with bosses, colleagues,
                    friends, and family, and give tips on how to simplify life so it is not overwhelming. I hope I can
                    inspire more people to drop unhealthy ways to cope and make life easier.</p>

                <p class="more-info">I'm Anna, a mother to 2 girls, a wife, a friend, a daughter, a sister, a worker,
                    and a student. I have just finished my second year at Centria University of Applied Sciences, and I
                    hope to graduate within 2-3 years with a Bachelor's degree in IT Engineering. While I am conducting
                    most of my studies in the evenings and during the weekends, I spend my daytime at a local company
                    working as a System developer mainly focusing on the company's ERP system. If I have any free time
                    left after working and studying, I like to go swimming and I also go to the gym. I love to bake,
                    spend time in nature, and read. When I graduate, I will get one or five dogs depending on what I can
                    convince the rest of the family to accept.</p>
