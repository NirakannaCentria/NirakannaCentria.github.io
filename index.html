                    I will share my experiences with burnout and how I had to change my life and my way of thinking to
                    not only survive but also thrive in live. I am still halfway surviving, but my goal is to thrive. In
                    this corner I will share my lessons learned, give tips on setting healthy boundries with bosses,
                    colleauges, friends and family and give tips on how to simplify life so it is not overwhelming. I
                    hope I can inspire more people to drop unhealthy ways to cope and make life easier</p>

                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I'm Anna, a mother to 2 girls, a wife, a friend, a daughter, a sister, a worker and student. I have
                    just finished my second year at Centria University of Applied Sciences, and I hope to graduate
                    within 2-3 years with a Bachelors degree in IT Engineering. While I am conducting most of my studies
                    in evenings and during the weekends I spend my daytime at a local company working as a System
                    developer mainly focusing on the company's ERP system.</p>
                <p>If I have any free time left after working and studying I like to go swimming and I also go to the
                    gym. I love to bake, spend time in nature and to read. When I graduate I will get one or five dogs
                    depending on what I can convince the rest of the family to accept</p>

                <p>Enjoy reading!</p>
